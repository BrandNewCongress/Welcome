# Welcome to Brand New Congress Tech
 
This is the official GitHub organization for Brand New Congress. All of the technology that we develop is created as open source projects by volunteers and housed in the [Brand New Congress Github repo](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress).

# Quick Start

Don't want to read much more and just hop in? [Take on one of these newbie friendly issues here](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3ABrandNewCongress+label%3Anewbie-friendly+). If you see an issue that doesn't have enough context for you to get to work on it, leave a comment asking us to explain more, and one of us will be sure to flesh it out!

# Where and how we work

We organize all our projects on Github. Whenever we have a new feature we want to implement or a bug we want to fix, we create an issue in the corresponding Github repository and discuss the issue there. We use labels on Github issues to track work. The labels we use across all our projects are:

* newbie-friendly: Issues that are easy for new people to start working on
* priority-high: High priority issues
* priority-low: Nice to haves that we don't want to prioritize
* status-proposed: Most new issues get this tag. Issues with this tag have not been accepted yet. Anything without this tag is an issue that has been accepted and should be worked on.

# How to commit a change

Brand New Congress projects use Gitflow to accept pull requests. To submit a change to a project:

* Fork the project to your own GitHub account (click "Fork" on the project page in GitHub)
* Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-new-feature)
* Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature')
* Push to the branch (git push origin my-new-feature)
* Create a new Pull Request
* Each project has a README that (hopefully) explains how to get started and how to run any tests or code validation. You should ensure that your changes use good code style, are appropriately commented, and don't break any tests (if applicable). 

# How to propose and hear about new projects

For projects that have no code yet, the relevant issues are on this repo! So if you think we should be working on something that we're not, [open an issue on this repository](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/Welcome/issues). If you want to hear about new projects we decided to work on, [watch this repo](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/Welcome/subscription).

# Checklist for creating a new project

When you make a brand new project in this organization, we ask that you do a few things:

* Set up the labels described on [above](#where-and-how-we-work).
* Add a license to the project. We default to AGPL-v3.0
* Add a README explaining at least how to run the project from a fresh clone and how to deploy the project

# Our technology stack

All of BNC's data exists in our campaign CRM which is called Nationbuilder. As a result, tools we use will often need to interface with Nationbuilder to get relevant data back into that system. Outside of Nationbuilder, we're open to different tech stacks, but we generally use JavaScript and deploy our projects to Heroku.
