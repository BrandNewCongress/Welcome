# Welcome to the Brand New Congress Dev Team
 
This is the official GitHub organization for [Brand New Congress](http://http://brandnewcongress.org/). The dev team at Brand New Congress is made of developers and designers that help all the other teams in the organization work better and build tools that will enable volunteers to create a new government in 2018. All of the technology that we develop is created as open source projects by volunteers and housed in the [Brand New Congress Github repo](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress).

## Quick Start

Don't want to read much more and just hop in? [Take on one of these newbie friendly issues here](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3ABrandNewCongress+label%3Anewbie-friendly+label%3Astatus-approved) and leave a comment on the issue saying that you are going to tackle it. If you see an issue that doesn't have enough context for you to get to work on it, leave a comment asking us to explain more, and one of us will be sure to flesh it out! Once you have a fix, [open a pull request](README.md#how-to-contribute). And feel free to come talk to us on [the ProgCode Slack in #brandnewcongress](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg0PcO8bGcFQwAPGHCHWhd3iATbkhYpLxgVLN5EKpbSP5R-A/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=send_form)!

## Goals for August, 2016

There are a couple big things we want to accomplish for August. Links go to relevant issues with discussion.

1. [Prepare for our September organizing house parties by creating an event portal for volunteers.](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/website/issues/87)
2. [Create a first version of our volunteer portal](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/website/issues/83)
3. [Finish porting our site from Nationbuilder to the website repo](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/website/issues/79)

## How we work

We organize around [projects on Github](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress). Subteams of the dev team are therefore just project teams. So, for example, if you want to be a part of the website team, just head over to [the website repository](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/website) and start working there! If you want to know what all the available projects are to work on, [take a look at our main projects page](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress). 

Whenever we have a new feature we want to implement or a bug we want to fix, we create an issue in the corresponding Github repository and discuss the issue there. We use labels on Github issues to track work. The labels we use across all our projects are:

* newbie-friendly: Issues that are easy for new people to start working on
* priority-high: High priority issues
* status-approved: Issues that have been approved and should be worked on!  Anything else is a new issue that has yet to be triaged.

## [How to contribute](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/welcome/wiki/How-to-Contribute)

## Our technology stack

All of BNC's data exists in our campaign CRM which is called Nationbuilder. As a result, tools we use will often need to interface with Nationbuilder to get relevant data back into that system. Outside of Nationbuilder, we're open to different tech stacks, but we generally use JavaScript and deploy our projects to Heroku.

## Design projects

We want to use Github to organize design projects as well, but we are still getting started creating our design infrastructure and brand.  Are you a designer who wants to get involved?  Come drop into our [Slack](http://shift-ops.brandnewcongress.org) and show us some of your work!

## How to propose and hear about new projects

For projects that have no code yet, the relevant issues are on this repo! So if you think we should be working on something that we're not, [open an issue on this repository](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/Welcome/issues). If you want to hear about new projects we decided to work on, [watch this repo](https://github.com/BrandNewCongress/Welcome/subscription).

## How to request work from the BNC dev team

BNC teams work together by being able to request work from each other. If you are on another BNC team and would like help from the dev team, open an issue on this repository or on the website repository using the "Issues" tab and one of us will discuss the work with you there.  Thanks!

## Interested in joining a team other than the dev team?

## Questions? Comments? Problems? Slack?

If you think we need to add anything else to this README, open a pull request! If you have a question about a project, comment on an existing issue or create a new issue on this repository!  If you had any trouble with this process, open an issue on this repository as well! And if you just want to say hi or have any general questions, join us on [the ProgCode Slack in #brandnewcongress](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeg0PcO8bGcFQwAPGHCHWhd3iATbkhYpLxgVLN5EKpbSP5R-A/viewform?c=0&w=1&usp=send_form)!
